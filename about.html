                            <p> Robert R. (Bob) Smith is a 6th generation Texan who has practiced law for over 26 years.  While he is well-known and respected in the Williamson and Travis County legal community, his practice has taken him to jurisdictions all across the states of Texas and Arkansas.  Prior to entering the Bar, Bob had a career performing scientific research.  His previous work experience enables him to analyze legal issues and fact situations in an orderly, precise, and logical manner.  However, he understands the essential need for a strong, fervent, and passionate argument in effectively advocating for his clients.<br><br>Growing up on a family farm and ranch near the small town of Maypearl, Texas, he learned to appreciate the genuineness, work ethic, self-reliance, and compassion of the local farmers and small-town citizens.  He has never lost sight of their attributes and wisdom and he incorporates their qualities in his approach to the legal profession.<br><br>Bob’s initial law practice centered on assisting rural citizens—mostly small farmers—and advocating their positions as they dealt with the wide variety of governmental programs relating to agriculture.  Later, he served as the General Counsel for the Texas Senate’s Sub-committee on Agriculture as well as the Sub-committee for Elections and Ethics.  It was with the latter that he helped establish the Texas Ethics Commission which still serves as the watchdog authority for Texas government.  After completing his legislative assignments, he became Assistant General Counsel for the Texas Water Commission (TCEQ), of the predecessor of the current Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the state agency tasked with the statewide duty to protect human health and the environment.<br><br>In 1995, Bob opened the Law Office of Robert R. Smith.  Initially his practice was general in nature, but he soon discovered he enjoyed the field of criminal law.  Today, his practice is predominately criminal law although he assists his clients in some non-criminal matters.  Similarly he utilizes his environmental background by representing clients facing non-criminal administrative enforcement proceedings with the T.C.E.Q.</p>
